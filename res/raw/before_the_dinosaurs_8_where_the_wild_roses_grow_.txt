Album: 	BEFORE THE DINOSAURS

WHERE THE WILD ROSES GROW 
 
Like I am hurting like I am bleeding
I am covering up inside
I am losing what I believe in
I am ready to start a fight
I know how you made it
You gamble with my faith
I come .. I am speeding
All I got to protect my life

chorus
There is a place inside my mind
Where I want to go
There is a secret place inside me
That nobody knows
All the dreams I free myself
I just wanna go to the place
Where the wild roses grow

No more hurting yes I am bleeding
All I want is to stop this crime
All I am losing all I am believing in
I am ready to leave tonight
I am lonely I feel broken
Your defeat has stole my life
I know I am stronger
All I got to let go tonight

Chorus
There is a place inside my mind
Where I want to go
There is a secret place inside me
That nobody knows
All the dreams I free myself
I just wanna go to the place
Where the wild roses grow

Wild roses grow

Chorus
There is a place inside my mind
Where I want to go
There is a secret place inside me
That nobody knows
All the dreams I free myself
I just wanna go to the place
Where the wild roses grow
