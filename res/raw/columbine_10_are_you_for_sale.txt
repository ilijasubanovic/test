Album: COLUMBINE

ARE YOU FOR SALE

Are you for sale?
As you walking down the street
Are you for sale?
Says the man who can't see his feet
I was a baby and you wounds will heal 
I'm a woman

Are you underage?
Are you over-qualified?
How do you feel?
When they say everything has a price
What's your price?
I was a baby and your wound will
I'm a woman

If every woman & man isn't me
Tell, tell me which part is he?
And if every woman & man isn't him
Tell, tell me which part is me?
