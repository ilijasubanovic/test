PICTURE OF MOON
 
If you look inside of me
you will find a picture of the moon
if i look inside of you
you wonder who's got the red boots on

you are smiling
you are travelling
your are dying your hair

if i turn you inside out
i'd find a piece of cake
if you turn me upside down
i wonder if the moon would break

you are smiling
you are travelling
you are dying your hair

you are smiling
you are laughing
now you're cutting your hair

it's so easy to say
it's so easy to do
it's so easy to day
it's so easy for you

cuz i will carry
i will carry

i will carry the moon vor you!
