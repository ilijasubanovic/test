Album: COLUMBINE

LULLA GOODBYE
 
You were always a star to me
but i was your bitter fault
you wrote so many songs about me
and i memorise them all
and you played piano
and we thanked you with
i wrote the lyrics
now i cant be unplay it in my head

let me sing you a lullaby
let me sing aou a lullaby
let me sing you a lullaby
let me sind you a lullaby

you were always a star to me 
and this is my story looking at the sky
i hope you're shinig down you on me
as i sing you my lullaby
sometimes you hate me
i guess mostly you just dont care
if im lucky you'd almost like me
but you always bite your lips in this 

let me sing you a lullaby
let me sing you a lullaby
cos to me you always closed your eyes
let me sing you a lullaby
closed eyes hide open
closed eyes hide open 
to me you alawys closed your eyes
let me sing you a lullaby
lulla goodbye 
lulla goodbye
lulla goodbye
