RECIPE

Hold me like I'm a baby,
I will always be safe in your arms.
I'll feel in and I am dreaming,
I'm humming my way to the stars.

I can't reach the stars from where I am.
I can't reach the stars from where I am.

Tell me, what is the recipe,
secret of eternity
No more loving me or leave me.
Not a year, not three or four,
Forever is in my heart,
wth you evermore.

Stand by me, I am your baby,
You will always be safe in my arms.
The season I don't think about reasons,
I just wanna lose it and wish upon a star.

I can't reach the stars from where I am.
I can't reach the stars from where I am.

Tell me what is the recipe,
secret of eternity,
No more loving me or leave me.
Not a year, not three or four,
Forever is in my heart,
with you evermore.

Ooooooh ooooh oooooh
You can take it far to the morning star
thousand children laughing in your eyes
Ooooh you're back for to me, baby can't you see
that the sky's filled with butterflies.

Tell me what is the recipe,
secret of eternity,
No more loving me or leave me.
Not a year, not three or four,
Forever is in my heart,
with you evermore.

Ooooh Oooooh Oooooooh

[Tell me what is the recipe,
secret of eternity,
No more loving me or leave me.
Not a year, not three or four,
Forever is in my heart,
with you evermore.]
