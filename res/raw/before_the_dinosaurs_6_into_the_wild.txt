Album: 	BEFORE THE DINOSAURS

INTO THE WILD

I haven't seen you lately
don't know what life has made of you
I'm always gonna be your friend
What is that to you?
I've become a stranger 
but I want to let you in
so much has changed
I don't know where to begin
I see right through you
from beginning to the end
I see right through you
that's what made us friends

You'll always be my first love
You're ... heart space and time
You're someone I still thing the world of
But we got lost, we got lost into the wild
and I got lost, I got lost into the wild

I never felt that I was cool enough to be your friend
I guess that's kind of funny,
don't know how the story ends
I've never been a pleaser
I've never been a fan
but I never felt any better
than when you took my hand

I see right through you
from beginning to the end
I see right through you
that's what made us friends

You'll always be my first love
You're ... heart space and time
You're someone I still thing the world of
But we got lost, we got lost into the wild
and I got lost, I got lost into the wild

We live, we live, we live, we live, we live, we live, we live, we live
We live, we live, we live, we live, we live, we live, we live, we live
So fast, so fast and we got lost in the past

You'll always be my first love
You're ... heart space and time
You're someone I still thing the world of
But we got lost, we got lost into the wild
and I got lost, I got lost into the wild

We live, we live, we live, we live, we live, we live, we live, we live
We live, we live, we live, we live, we live, we live, we live, we live
So fast, so fast and we got lost in the past
So fast, so fast and we got lost in the past
