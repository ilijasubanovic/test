ANTONY

I saw a man, he looked like a woman
I saw a woman, she recognized me
A boy they call Ellie
He, she dances "Sound Of Ten" on a Thursday

I could be your Antony
If you let me
I could be your Antony
At least for a while
I could be your Antony
If you let me 
I could be your Amsterdam
I could be your Antony
I could be your Antony
I could be your Antony
I could be your Amsterdam

I look at lines now, never ending
Cover your face in me
A girl they call Ellie
She picks up the guitar
He, she, it picks up the guitar
She picks up the guitar

I could be your Antony
If you let me
I could be your Antony
At least for a while
I could be your Antony
If you let me 
I could be your Amsterdam
I could be your Antony
I could be your Antony
At least for a while
I could be your Antony
I could be your Amsterdam

I'm the A to the N T O N Y
I'm the voice of sex for Antony
I can't wait for him to see that he's inside my melody

I could be your Antony
If you let me
I could be your Antony
At least for a while
I could be your Antony
If you let me 
I could be your Amsterdam
I could be your Antony
I could be your Antony
At least for a while
I could be your Antony
I could be your Amsterdam
I could be your Antony

I'm the A to the N T O N Y
I'm the voice of sex for Antony
I can't wait for him to see that he's inside my melody

I could be your Antony

I'm the A to the N T O N Y
I'm the voice of sex for Antony
I can't wait for him to see that he's inside my melody
