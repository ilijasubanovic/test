SOMETHING FROM NOTHING

This gonna be the first time I really see
How much you mean to me
This gonna be the first time I really know
How much I ought to show

If I could give you something from empty space
I would use my voice to put a smile on your face
Making something from nothing is what I do
And I will give it to you
And now I'll give it to you

This gonna be the first time I really am
What you think of me
This gonna be the first time I really feel
That this love could be real

If I could give you something from empty space
I would use my voice to put a smile on your face
Making something from nothing is what I do
And I will give it to you
And I will give it to you
And I will give it to you
(You know I'll give it to you)
And I'm gonna give it to you
(I will give it to you)
And now I'll give it to you

It's hard to describe exactly what I feel inside
Like I'm filled with stars
Letting go of time
Accepting the changes
So the world can stay the same
Forcing myself not to be playing games
It's hard to describe exactly what I feel inside
Like I'm filled with stars
Letting go of time
Accepting the changes
So the world can stay the same
Forcing myself not to be playing games

Cause we are used to use each other
And I am used to fool my lovers

If I could give you something from empty space
I would use my voice to put a smile on your face
Making something from nothing is what I do
And I am gonna give it to you
And I am gonna give it to you
(You know I give it to you)
And now I'll give it to you

If I could give you something from empty space
I would use my voice to put a smile on your face
Making something from nothing is what I do
And I will give it to you
