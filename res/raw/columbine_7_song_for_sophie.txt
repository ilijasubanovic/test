SONG FOR SOPHIE
 
This is a song for a girl called Sophie
used to write her name on my arm.
Time has made us strangers
and I don't know her anymore.

But I really hope she's made it
that someone took her home.
She was lost but wasn't missing
she would always walk alone.

She was always like a feather, in the air
I never knew if she was flying or falling
she was always like a feather, in my life.
I hope she flies, 
I hope she flies,
I hope she flies,
I hope she flies.

Because of her, I looks things that last:
I have a chain -where's your arm?
A promise can be broken,
I won't hunt you anymore 
no, no, no 

But I really hope she's made it
that someone took her home.
She was lost but wasn't missing
she would always walk alone.

She was always like a feather, in the air
I never knew if she was flying or falling
she was always like a feather, in my life.
I hope she flies ..

She.. La-la-la-la-la-la-la.

I hope she flies. (x4)

She.. La-la-la-la-la-la-la. (x4)

I hope she flies.

She was always like a feather, in the air
I never knew if she was flying or falling
she was always like a feather, in my life.
I hope she flies. (x5)

She.. La-la-la-la-la-la-la.
