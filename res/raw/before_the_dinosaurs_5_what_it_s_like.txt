Album: 	BEFORE THE DINOSAURS

WHAT IT'S LIKE 

I wanna know what is life
To live in London move to Paris
Learn what love is
But only if you come with me
I wanna know what is life
To struggle in New York tiny apartment bell if you ..
But only if you go with me

Chorus:
So won't you go with me ?
I want you go with me?
i want you go with me?
Never know until you try
And i wanna know what it's like
I wanna know what it's like

And if we're leaving tonight
Fly to LA we both be .. famous
But even if we don't we get ..
Still wanna know what it's like
to travel the world you and me in the bag packs
will know till we get back
you said for memories and faces .we laugh at


Chorus:
So won't you go with me ?
I want you go with me?
i want you go with me?
'cause you'll never know until you try
And i wanna know what it's like
I wanna know what it's like

No plans we're make it .. as we go
You know that i would do it
Explore each other one way or another

[Chorus:]
Cause you never ever knew, never ever knew
You never ever knew, never ever knew
You never ever knew until you try
I wanna know what it's like mhmm yeah yeah
And i wanna know what it's like
And there's a thousand children laughing in my eyes
So don't' be scared just come come with me
You just gotta go with it and jump into your life
I can think of six impossible things before breakfast we should do
