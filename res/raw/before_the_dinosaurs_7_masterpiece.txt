MASTERPIECE

I want to show you how I really am
So let me can get down, down, down, down
I have a little golden bird inside
It starts to sing when you around, round, round, around

Tell me all your dreams
Your brain is beautiful
You are full of light
Don't be afraid to try

Baby you're a masterpiece
Thousand years of poetry
I just wanna scream your name
You're a king of fantasy
Celebrating mystery
I want you to feel the same

I wanna get to know
You talking like
So let me can get down, down, down, down
I have a little golden bird inside
It starts to sing when you around, round, round, around

Tell me all your dreams
Your brain is beautiful
You are full of light
Don't be afraid to try

Baby you're a masterpiece
Thousand years of poetry
I just wanna scream your name
You're a king of fantasy
Celebrating mystery
I want you to feel the same

You lying evergreen
The best thing I've ever seen
Now it is the time
To let the fairytale outside my mind

Baby you're a masterpiece
Thousand years of poetry
I just wanna scream your name
You're a king of fantasy
Celebrating mystery
I want you to feel the same
Baby you're a masterpiece
Thousand years of poetry
I just wanna scream your name
You're a king of fantasy
Celebrating mystery
I want you to feel the same
