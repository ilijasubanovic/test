GERONIMO

Ge-ge-e-jo-jo uhh la-la hmm
let's go geronimo

I'll get you out of here,
there's too much talking in this atmosphere,
Cause I just wanna get you out of here,
my baby gonna get a lot of me, oouh.

she goes
ge-ge-e jo-jo uhh-la-la hmm
let's go geronimo
sa-say-e so-so uh-la-la hmm
let's go geronimo
ge-ge-e jo-jo uhh-la-la hm
let's go!

And I'm breaking
I'm breaking away,
"I'm aiming power power shots"
and I'm giving all I got.
I'm fearless
I'm fearless today
I paint my face with teardrip-drops
and I'm kissing underdogs

Ge-ge-e-jo-jo uhh la-la hmm
let's go geronimo
Ge-ge-e-jo-jo uhh la-la hmm
let's go geronimo

When I get you out of here,
there's too much smoking in this atmosphere,
I just wanna see you bright and clear,
my baby gonna get a lot of me, oouh.


she goes
ge-ge-e jo-jo uhh-la-la hmm
let's go geronimo
sa-say-e so-so uh-la-la hmm
let's go geronimo
ge-ge-e jo-jo uhh-la-la hm
let's go!

And I'm breaking
I'm breaking away,
I'm aiming power power shots
and I'm giving all I got.
I'm fearless
I'm fearless today
I paint my face with teardrip-drops
and I'm kissing underdogs
