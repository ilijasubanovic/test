Album: 	BEFORE THE DINOSAURS

AMERICA 

America
America
America

There is a rainbow exploding from my heart
Things that can grow in could be smart
I have a dress made out of ..
There is secrecy in my mind
I always look for things I cannot fins
I was been to sing between the lights
All the dreams my father had ..got to do
You said go out and find the best for you
You are my daughter and I only want to see you shine
If you make it in America you can make it anywhere
If you make it in America you can take it anywhere

There is a rainbow exploding from my heart
Inside lighting up the dark
It all begins with a spark
You know you got to go
All the dreams my mother had all she never got to do
She was a dancer but never got to follow through
She said me and I am gonna make her shine
If you make it in America you can make it anywhere
If you make it in America you can take it anywhere

The only way you will ever know
Is when you just let go ..

If you make it in America you can make it anywhere
If you make it in America you can take it anywhere
If you make it in America you can make it anywhere
If you make it in America you can take it anywhere
