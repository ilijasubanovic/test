LITTLE LOUIE
 
Outside their fighting, we are safe.
Out there, they are hiding. 
Not for fun.
Outside they look bigger, inside their not.
Little, little Louie and I, could be free.
If we danced about the door.

Outside they are stealing, keep it safe.
Out there, they are archiving. 
So they say.
Sometimes they are lying, so are we.
Little, little Louie and I, could be free.
If we danced about the door.

What is a house when its no longer a home.
What is a room when there are no walls.
How do you know when your safe?
Little, little Louie and I,
Could be free.
If we danced about the door.

Little, little Louie and I,
Could be free.
If we danced about the door.

Could be free.
