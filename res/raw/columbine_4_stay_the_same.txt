STAY THE SAME
 
I remember as a young girl
I thought I should conquer the world
Guess I'm crazy, yeah, I'm wild
Together we can dance till the end of time

Move your 
Bim,Bam,Body
Badim badam body(2x)

Music comes from a broken heart
I wish i could have the (???)
You're lovely and I am fine
Together we could dance.....

I'll never Stay The Same
I'll never Stay The Same

Don't be scared to walk on the line
I didn't come to waste my time
You're crazy and I am wild
Together we can dance till the end of time

Move your 
Bim,Bam,Body
Badim badam body(2x)

I'll never Stay The Same
I'll never Stay The Same

Bim,Bam,Body
Badim badam body(2x)

We all just laughing
And it is just for fun
You are still just my number one
we are all just laughing at the window sun?
