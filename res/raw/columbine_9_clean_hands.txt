CLEAN HANDS
 
Take my hand
Reachin' to my soul.
Have you ever found
Anything so pure before?

I touched your hand
You lost control.
Do you really want me to
Break down and cry?

She was just a little girl
She didn't know how to say \"stop\"
She was just a little girl
Please raise your hand when you had enough
She was just a little girl
She didn't know how to say \"stop\"
She was just a little girl

Where do all the little girls go (and)
They're ain't save at night
Where do all the little girls go and
Bounced 'em by mister right

Take your time
Look into my eyes
Have you ever seen
Anything so pure before?

She was just a little girl
She didn't know how to say \"stop\"
She was just a little girl
Please raise your hand when you had enough
She was just a little girl
She didn't know how to say \"stop\"
She was just a little girl

Where do all the little girls go (and)
They're ain't save at night
Where do all the little girls go and
Bounced 'em by mister right

Where do all the little girls go (and)
They're ain't save at night
Where do all the little girls go and
Bounced 'em by mister right

Where do all the little girls go (and)
They're ain't save at night
Where do all the little girls go and
Bounced 'em by mister right

Why?
Why?
Why say stop?
I had had enough
Stop
