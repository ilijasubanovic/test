Album: 	BEFORE THE DINOSAURS

RECONNECT 

You close your eyes than i close mine
You don't need to see now
The break of dawn it make the battle seeing wonder night
The stars are lined and we know longer uncutted broken
Fate to fate as we touch we strike a light

Chorus:
We reconnect, we're resurrected
Healings all the way eye y
We're almost home it's too hurts but it ain't over
We read the line and somehow i feel
We might be here to stay ey ey
This a lost love ready for come back
We reconnect, this a lost love ready to come back
We reconnect

I turn around to see the pain somehow i lasted
We barely ..but why the shadows of or hearts
The caller is gone and all the pieces fall into place again
Fate to fate as we touch we strike a light

Chorus:
We reconnect, we're resurrected
Healings all the way eye y
We're almost home it's too hurts but it ain't over
We read the line and somehow i feel
We might be here to stay ey ey
This a lost love ready for come back
We reconnect, this a lost love ready to come back
We reconnect
This a lost love ready for come back
We reconnect

..and restart
We recall and re love
Fate to fate as we touch we strike a light
We strike a light
We strike a light
Almost home
Is too ..but it ain't over
We .. and i'll be here to stay ey ey
This is a lost love ready for comeback
We reconnect
This is a lost love ready ro come back we reconnect
And .. and it's always hit you
..hits you
You're lost and .. no more
This is a lost love ready to come back
We reconnect.
