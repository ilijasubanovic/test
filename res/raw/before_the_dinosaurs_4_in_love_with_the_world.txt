Album: 	BEFORE THE DINOSAURS

IN LOVE WITH THE WORLD

You're in love with a girl
who's in love with the world,
and all I wanna do
is spend a little time with you.
You spend all your time waiting.

Told you right from the start
that I've known 9 to 5
Not planning to stay
wish I could see you evereyday, but
I'm chasing a dream for a living.

I'm not what you wanted,
you're not what I needed,
this love is a burden,
my heart can repeat it.
I've been here before,
gotta let you go.

I believe in you and me,
I hope to be everything
you ever wanted,
you're asking for more,
you're too insecured.

You're in love with a girl
who's in love with the world,
and all I wanna do
is spend a little time with you.
You spend all your time waiting.

Told you right from the start
that I've known 9 to 5
Not planning to stay
wish I could see you evereyday, but
I'm chasing a dream for a living.

You know it's a fact that,
my suitcases packed,
then I beg you to say: it's ok,
I can go to the end of the world
and still be your girl.

Call me on the phone,
say you hate to be alone.
It's my fault that you're
always cheating.
Been here before,
you're too insecured.

You're in love with a girl
who's in love with the world,
and all I wanna do
is spend a little time with you.
You spend all your time waiting.

Told you right from the start
that I've known 9 to 5
Not planning to stay
wish I could see you evereyday, but
I'm chasing a dream for a living.

Oh oh oh the world is calling,
oh oh oh the world is calling,
oh the world is waking up for me.

You're in love with a girl
who's in love with the world,
and all I wanna do
is spend a little time with you.
You spend all your time waiting.

Told you right from the start
that I've known 9 to 5
Not planning to stay
wish I could see you evereyday, but
I'm chasing a dream for a living.

You're in love with a girl,
who's in love with the world.

You're in love with a girl,
who's in love with the world.

You're in love with a girl,
who's in love with the world.

You're in love with a girl,
who's in love with the world.
